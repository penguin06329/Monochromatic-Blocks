Add a simple monochromatic block.

It glows when placed and the proper tool is a pickaxe. (Maybe)
However, I believe it can be broken with bare hands.
And let me tell you, the explosion resistance is really stupid, about a **million** to a **billion.**
It's already beyond bedrock, command blocks, and barrier blocks.
It's bad.
